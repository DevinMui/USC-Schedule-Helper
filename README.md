## Note

This was one of my first projects in JavaScript, and was my first chrome extension ever. I'm in the process of rewriting it, but I don't know how far I'll get as I'm graduating soon and assume that I'll lose all motivation to work on this as soon as I do. 

The Schedule Helper relies heavily on globals, and isn't particularly good at handling failure. I'm making this code public so that someone can take over/fix possible problems after it becomes abandonware. If you have any questions about how it works, feel free to reach out - I've tried to make up for the beginner mistakes with a substantial amount of comments, but it's still fairly lacking.
